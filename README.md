# can-wifi-gateway-stiebel-eltron
Gateway to communicate with Stiebel Eltron heat pump controllers via an HTTP-based API. It communicates with the heatpump controller using the native, proprietary CAN protocol and provides the features and data through a more integration friendly HTTP API to the outside. Developed for deployment on an ESP8266 board with a separate CAN adapter/bridge.
